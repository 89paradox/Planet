Planet is a **maintained, feature-rich and a flexible** launcher. It is supported everywhere: Just install PyQt5, Python, and MCPi, and you're done! Planet was created because none of the other launchers were universal, stable, maintained and feature-rich.
## Installation
#### Prerequisites
* [Minecraft Pi: Reborn](https://jenkins.thebrokenrail.com) AppImage or DEB install
* PyQt5
* Python 3
* `pypresence`
* `pyqtdarkmode`
* Pillow

If you're installing a DEB, all of them with the exception of Minecraft: Pi Edition: Reborn will be automatically installed. Please install an AppImage for the latest build. If you want a DEB, please consider checking out [MCPi-Reborn++](https://github.com/mobilegmyt/mcpi-reborn-extended).
#### Installation
1. Download the DEB from the releases section.
2. Install the DEB using `apt`
3. Follow the on-screen instructions

###### Conclusion
- Use Planet if you want a maintained and a feature-rich launcher.
- Use gMCPIL if you are on Debian Bullseye, using a DEB install OR want a basic experience
- Use jMCPIL if you're using a DEB install on a distro other than Debian Bullseye
- Don't use pipan, it's a dirty prototype, not a working launcher
