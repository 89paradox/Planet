**Is there a a launcher for MCPi that works everywhere and has all the essenitial features?**:
Yes there is. Introducing Planet. Planet was made because the other launchers didn't work properly or were unmaintained.
And, no launcher supports AppImage, thus Planet is required to run new versions of MCPi-Reborn.-->
